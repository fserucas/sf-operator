This document gives details about the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that the SF-Operator installs on a cluster.

## CRDs

The Custom Resources installed by the SF-Operator are described in the following OpenAPI specs:

* [SoftwareFactory](./../../config/crd/bases/sf.softwarefactory-project.io_softwarefactories.yaml)
* [LogServer](./../../config/crd/bases/sf.softwarefactory-project.io_logservers.yaml)

The spec is constantly evolving during alpha development, and should be considered
unstable but the ultimate source of truth for documentation about its properties.
