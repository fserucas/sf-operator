# Delete SF-Operator related resources

The `sf-operator` CLI can be used to [wipe resources and remove the installed operator](./../reference/cli/index.md#wipe):

```sh
sf-operator SF wipe --all
```

For further details on how to remove an operator, see [OLM's upstream documentation](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/tasks/uninstall-operator/).
